#Password-Manager

This is a secure, desktop-based password manager that I wrote in java during the summer of 2018. I used JavaFX to build a GUI, and the java cryptographic library to save passwords securely.
I encrypt the passwords using the AES encryption algorithm, and then write them to a JSON file using the maven package Jackson Databind. This method allows them to be portable and easily migrated between machines. The software is written using the MVC pattern.

I currently plan to rewrite this to expand its current functionality and improve its system design.
